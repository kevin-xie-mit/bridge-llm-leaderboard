<h2>üìú Background</h2>
<p>Recent advances in <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> have demonstrated transformative potential in <strong>healthcare</strong>,  yet concerns remain around their reliability and clinical validity across diverse clinical tasks, specialties, and languages. To support timely and trustworthy evaluation, building upon our <a href="https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIra2400012">systematic review</a> of global clinical text resources, we introduce <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19467">BRIDGE</a>, <strong>a multilingual benchmark that comprises 87 real-world clinical text tasks spanning nine languages and more than one million samples</strong>. Furthermore, we construct this leaderboard of LLM in clinical text understanding by systematically evaluating <strong>52 state-of-the-art LLMs</strong> (by 2025/04/28).</p>

<h2>üèÜ BRIDGE Leaderboard</h2>
<p>BRIDGE features three leaderboards, each evaluating LLM performance in clinical text tasks under a distinct inference strategy:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Zero shot</strong>: Only the task instructions and input data are  provided. The LLM is prompted to directly produce the target answer without any support.</li>
    <li><strong>Chain-of-Thought (CoT)</strong>: Task instructions explicitly guide the LLM to generate a step-by-step explanation of its reasoning process before providing the final answer, enhancing interpretability and reasoning transparency.</li>
    <li><strong>Few-shot</strong>: Five independent samples serve as examples, which leverage the LLM's capability of in-context learning to guide the model to conduct tasks. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, BRIDGE offers multiple <strong>model filters</strong> and <strong>task filters</strong> to enable users to explore LLM performance across <strong>different clinical contexts</strong>, empowering researchers and clinicians to make informed decisions and track model advancements over time.</p>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è How to Evaluate Your Model on BRIDGE ?</h2>
<h4>üìÇ Dataset Access</h4>
<p>All fully open-access datasets in BRIDGE are available in <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/YLab-Open/BRIDGE-Open">BRIDGE-Open</a>. To ensure the fairness of this leaderboard, we publicly release the following data for each task:
Five completed samples serve as few-shot examples, and all testing samples with instruction and input information.</p>

<p>Due to privacy and security considerations of clinical data, regulated-access datasets can not be directly published. However, all detailed task descriptions and their corresponding data sources are available in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19467">BRIDGE paper</a>.
Importantly, all 87 datasets have been verified to be either fully open-access or publicly accessible via reasonable request in <a href="https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIra2400012">our previous study</a>.</p>

<h4>üî• Result Submission and Evaluation</h4>
<p>If you would like to submit your model results to BRIDGE and demonstrate its performance, please follow these steps:</p>
<ul> 
    <li><strong>Run local inference:</strong> Download the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/YLab-Open/BRIDGE-Open">BRIDGE-Open</a> dataset and perform inference locally. Save the generated output of each sample in its "pred" field for each dataset file.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare your submission:</strong> Send your results to us (see the following Contact Information). Please clearly describe your model details and experimental settings, including the inference strategy used (zero-shot, few-shot, or CoT), and note any additional relevant configurations if applicable.</li> 
    <li><strong>Code Reference:</strong> About LLM inference, result extraction, and evaluation scheme, please refer to our <a href="https://github.com/YLab-Open/BRIDGE">BRIDGE GitHub repo</a>.</li> 
</ul>
We will review and evaluate your submission and update the leaderboard accordingly.
